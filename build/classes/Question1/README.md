# Question 1: Algorithm Design and Implementation

Let D denote the domain of two-dimensional square matrices of positive integers. The same integer may be stored in more than one element of A ∈ D.
Given A ∈ D and a positive integer, p, the FindElement problem is to determine whether or not p is contained in A.
